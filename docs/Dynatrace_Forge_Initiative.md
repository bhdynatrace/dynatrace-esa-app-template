# Dynatrace Forge: AI-Enabled Solution Foundries

## Overview

**Dynatrace Forge** is an initiative to empower Solution Architects,
Consultants, Partners, and Customers with **AI-driven, high-productivity
virtual environments** that bring their observability visions to life.\
Each Forge VM combines **Claude**, **VS Code**, and **Dynatrace Platform
expertise** in a secure, isolated workspace that enables rapid solution
building while ensuring governance and best practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vision Statement

> **"Dream it. Build it. Govern it."**\
> Dynatrace Forge redefines what's possible by merging Claude's
> intelligence with the Dynatrace platform in secure, purpose-built AI
> environments.\
> Every Forge VM is an isolated innovation chamber where architects,
> consultants, partners, and customers can design, test, and ship
> high-impact observability solutions---without friction or risk.\
> Pre-trained Dynatrace skills and AI copilots accelerate every step,
> embedding governance and best practices by design.\
> The result: an ecosystem where **ideas become apps**, **insights
> become workflows**, and **innovation becomes culture**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose

-   **Enable safe innovation:** Isolated VM environments keep AI
    separate from corporate systems.
-   **Accelerate development:** Pre-configured with Dynatrace tools,
    APIs, and Claude-enabled VS Code.
-   **Govern by design:** Every workspace includes built-in best
    practices and compliance standards.
-   **Empower every persona:** From internal architects to partners and
    customers---each can build, test, and deploy Dynatrace solutions
    faster than ever.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Components

-   **AI Assistant (Claude)** integrated directly in VS Code for code
    generation, DQL, Monaco, Terraform, and automation.
-   **Preloaded projects** with ready-to-edit examples for Dynatrace
    Apps, Workflows, and Extensions.
-   **Skills library** containing expertise packs---"DQL Expert,"
    "Workflow Builder," "App Designer," "SLO Engineer."
-   **Governance layer** that enforces platform and architectural best
    practices.
-   **Secure isolation** ensuring no access to corporate systems, ideal
    for partner and customer use.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example Use Cases

-   **Internal Architects:** Design new extensions or automation for
    customer solutions.
-   **Service Consultants:** Rapidly deploy reference architectures for
    observability engagements.
-   **Partners:** Co-develop integrations and accelerators in governed
    sandboxes.
-   **Customers:** Prototype Dynatrace Apps or Workflows hands-on,
    guided by embedded AI skills.
