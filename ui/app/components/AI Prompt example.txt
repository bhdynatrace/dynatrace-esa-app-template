AI Prompt example: 

ok I have a really crazy ask, I'm thinking that it would be super cool for when the user is on that AI Mindset topic section that you have a white line just above the content header, and then you have a little white stick figure with a small circle head in the center of the line and he paces random distances walking on the white line with what looks like his hands behind his back, walking left to right and every once in a while he stops in the middle and looks directly at the user, puts his arms wide open up in the air for a few seconds and then returns back to pacing back and forth. Don't do it yet but is that something you can do?
