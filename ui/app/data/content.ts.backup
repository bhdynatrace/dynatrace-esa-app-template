## RAG Architecture Overview

![RAG Architecture](https://community.intersystems.com/sites/default/files/inline/images/images/image(9789).png)

*The diagram above shows the complete end-to-end RAG workflow: from ingesting massive datasets through embeddings and vector storage, to query processing and AI-generated responses powered by InterSystems technology*

---

## Executive Summary

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is the technology that allows AI systems to answer questions using your organization's private documents and knowledge base - without expensive retraining or data security risks.

**Think of it this way**: Instead of training an AI from scratch on your company data (expensive and risky), RAG lets AI "look up" relevant information from your documents in real-time, just like a research assistant consulting a library before answering a question.

---

## The Business Problem

**Challenge**: Pre-trained AI models (like ChatGPT) don't know about:
- Your company's internal policies and procedures
- Your customer-specific data
- Your proprietary knowledge base
- Recent information (models have knowledge cutoff dates)

**Traditional Solution**: Retrain the entire AI model on your data
- **Cost**: Millions of dollars
- **Risk**: Your private data becomes part of the model
- **Maintenance**: Must retrain constantly as data changes

**RAG Solution**: Keep your data separate, let AI search it when needed
- **Cost**: Minimal infrastructure
- **Risk**: Data stays private and secure
- **Maintenance**: Update documents anytime, AI sees changes immediately

---

## How RAG Works: The 3 Key Components

*(Refer to the architecture diagram at the top to visualize each component)*

### 1. **Chunking**: Breaking Down Knowledge

**What It Is**: Splitting large documents into smaller, digestible pieces

**Why It Matters**:
- AI models have limited "attention span" (context windows)
- Searching through smaller chunks is faster and more precise
- Find exactly the relevant paragraph, not the entire 200-page manual

**Business Example**:
- Your 500-page employee handbook becomes 1,000 searchable chunks
- When someone asks "What's the vacation policy?", the AI searches only relevant sections
- Response time: seconds instead of minutes

**Key Metrics**:
- Chunk size: 200-500 words (optimized for retrieval speed and accuracy)
- Overlap: 10-20% between chunks (ensures context isn't lost at boundaries)

---

### 2. **Embeddings**: Creating a Searchable Map

**What It Is**: Converting text into numerical representations (vectors) that capture meaning

**Why It Matters**:
- AI can find documents by **meaning**, not just keyword matching
- "laptop battery life" will find documents about "portable computer power duration"
- Understands synonyms, context, and semantic relationships

**Business Example**:
- Employee asks: "How do I request time off?"
- Traditional search: Looks for exact words "request time off"
- Embedding search: Finds "vacation approval process", "leave of absence forms", "PTO submission"

**Technical Note** *(for those interested)*:
- Each chunk becomes a vector with 768-1536 dimensions
- Stored in a **Vector Database** (specialized for fast similarity search)
- Similar concepts cluster together in vector space

**Performance**:
- Search speed: Milliseconds across millions of documents
- Accuracy: 85-95% retrieval precision for well-structured content

---

### 3. **RAG**: Putting It All Together

**The Workflow** (see diagram):

1. **Setup Phase** (one-time):
   - Your private documents are split into **chunks**
   - Each chunk is converted into an **embedding** (vector)
   - Vectors are stored in a **Vector Store** for fast retrieval

2. **Query Phase** (every user question):
   - User asks a question: *"What's our remote work policy?"*
   - Question is converted into an embedding
   - System searches vector store for most similar chunks
   - Top 3-5 most relevant chunks are retrieved

3. **Generation Phase**:
   - Retrieved chunks + original question = **Context**
   - Context is sent to pre-trained LLM (like GPT-4, Claude)
   - LLM generates answer based on your actual documents
   - Response includes citations to source documents

**Security Advantage**:
- Your documents never leave your infrastructure
- Pre-trained model never sees your data during training
- Access controls on documents are respected
- Audit trail of what information was accessed

---

## Why This Matters for Our Organization

### **Speed to Value**
- Deploy in weeks, not years
- No model retraining required
- Works with existing document repositories

### **Cost Efficiency**
- Leverage pre-trained models ($0.01-$0.10 per query)
- Avoid custom model training (millions of dollars)
- Scale horizontally with demand

### **Data Security**
- Documents stay in your environment
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control
- Compliance-friendly (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)

### **Flexibility**
- Update documents anytime - changes reflect immediately
- Support multiple languages
- Integrate with existing tools (SharePoint, Confluence, etc.)
- No vendor lock-in

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### **Customer Support**
- Agent asks: "How do I handle a refund for international orders?"
- RAG retrieves: Refund policy, international shipping terms, currency conversion rules
- Result: Accurate answer in seconds, consistent across all agents

### **Employee Onboarding**
- New hire asks: "What benefits am I eligible for?"
- RAG retrieves: Benefits handbook, eligibility rules, enrollment deadlines
- Result: Self-service onboarding, reduced HR burden

### **Compliance & Legal**
- Analyst asks: "What are our data retention requirements for customer data?"
- RAG retrieves: Compliance policies, legal documentation, industry regulations
- Result: Confident answers backed by official documents

---

- **Long-period monitoring**: Track data volumes over 7-14 day periods, not just real-time
- **Trend-based thresholds**: Identify when volumes trend >35% higher over the monitoring window
- **Automated provisioning**: Trigger infrastructure scaling and provisioning workflows based on trends
- **Flexible querying**: Analyze any data source or metric, not just predefined dashboards

**The Gap**: Traditional monitoring focused on real-time thresholds, not volumetric trends over extended periods

## The Solution: Volumetric Explorer Gen3 App

**Development Time**: Built in approximately 10 hours total

**Deployed To**: Same Dynatrace environment (https://jhl74831.apps.dynatrace.com)

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Flexible DQL Query Input
- Users provide any DQL query to analyze
- Query results must include: date, hour, and volume fields
- Example: Log volumes, metric aggregations, entity counts, custom data

#### 2. 3D Volumetric Visualization
The app creates an interactive 3D visualization where:
- **X-axis**: Days (30-day period)
- **Z-axis**: Hours of day (0-23, covering full 24-hour cycle)
- **Y-axis (height)**: Volume value
- **Color gradient**: Visual indicator of volume intensity
  - Green: Low volume
  - Yellow: Medium volume
  - Orange: Elevated volume
  - Red: High volume

Users can rotate, zoom, and interact with the 3D chart to identify patterns across time and hours.

#### 3. Trend Analysis Engine

**Configurable Analysis Parameters**:
- **Evaluation Period**: Select 1-30 days for trend analysis
- **Hour Range**: Focus on specific hours (e.g., business hours 9-17, or full 24-hour day)
- **Comparison Modes**:
  - **Start Period Comparison**: Compare all days to the first day in the period
  - **Day-over-Day**: Compare each day to the previous day

**Calculated Metrics**:
- Daily volume totals within specified hour range
- Percentage change trends
- Overall trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Visual trend line chart with color-coded indicators

**Example Output**:
> "Volumes are trending UP by 42.3% over the last 14 days (hours 9-17)"

#### 4. Auto-Generated Dynatrace Workflows

**The Key Innovation**: Based on the configured trend analysis settings, the app can auto-generate:
- **Dynatrace Workflow definitions** with:
  - DQL query embedded
  - Volumetric trending logic built-in
  - Configured evaluation period, hour range, and thresholds
  - Schedule settings (e.g., run hourly, daily)

**Workflow Integration**:
- Users can review the generated workflow
- Adjust threshold actions (e.g., "if trend >35%, trigger provisioning")
- Add downstream actions:
  - Create ServiceNow tickets
  - Trigger infrastructure provisioning APIs
  - Send notifications to teams
  - Execute custom automation scripts

**Benefits**:
- Zero manual workflow creation
- Settings from UI automatically translated to workflow code
- Proven trend detection logic packaged for reuse
- Rapid deployment of monitoring-to-action automation

## Business Impact
